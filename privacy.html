    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Effective date: February 12, 2026</p>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how BlueGuard Authenticator ("App") collects, uses, and protects information.
      The App is provided by <strong>SimHaDo Apps</strong>, developer <strong>Danyil Skrypnichenko</strong>
      (<a href="mailto:quicktasksup@gmail.com">quicktasksup@gmail.com</a>).
    </p>

    <h2>1. Data We Process</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>User-entered security data</strong>: tokens, password entries, secure notes, backup codes, labels, and metadata you create.</li>
      <li><strong>Device/security state</strong>: lock status and in-app settings needed for protection features.</li>
      <li><strong>Purchase state</strong>: subscription or entitlement status provided by Apple for premium functionality.</li>
      <li><strong>Diagnostics</strong> (if enabled): limited crash/performance telemetry to improve reliability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How Data Is Used</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide core app functionality (authentication codes, secure storage, search, and backup/restore flows).</li>
      <li>Maintain security controls such as app lock and anti-tamper behavior.</li>
      <li>Validate premium access and improve app quality and stability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Encryption and Storage</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Sensitive app content is intended to be protected by local device security mechanisms and app-level safeguards.</li>
      <li>When backup/sync features are used, data is encrypted before transmission when supported by the active configuration.</li>
      <li>You are responsible for your device passcode, biometric setup, and recovery credentials.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We do not sell personal data.</li>
      <li>We only share data with service providers when required to operate features (for example, cloud infrastructure or payment validation), and only under applicable legal and contractual controls.</li>
      <li>We may disclose information where required by law, regulation, legal process, or to protect rights and safety.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Retention</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Data remains on your device unless you choose backup or deletion actions.</li>
      <li>If cloud backup is enabled, retention depends on your account and provider rules until you delete stored items.</li>
      <li>Diagnostics data retention is limited to what is reasonably necessary for debugging and quality improvement.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Your Choices and Rights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You may edit or delete stored content directly inside the App.</li>
      <li>You can disable optional features like cloud sync or analytics where controls are provided.</li>
      <li>You may request support related to privacy via email.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The App is not directed to children under the age where parental consent is required by local law.
      We do not knowingly collect personal information from children in violation of applicable law.
    </p>

    <h2>8. International Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>
      If third-party processors are used, data may be processed in jurisdictions different from your own.
      Appropriate safeguards are applied as required by law.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Security Notice</h2>
    <p>
      No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure. While we design for strong security, users should follow
      best practices: enable device passcode, biometrics, secure backups, and keep software updated.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Changes to this Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect legal, technical, or product changes.
      Updated versions will be published on this page with a revised effective date.
